# Basic_website
A website for a bakery business.

This is a website that I made to learn basics of web dev. 
It was made using python, html, css, and some javascript.
the frameworks and libraries used include: Bootstrap, Flask, WTForms, sqlite, and smtplib.

There are multiple issues with the website-
1) It is empty.
There is not much content in the website and it looks bland.

3) The validators for the form do not work very well.
I'm not sure why but I cannot seem to get validators to work properly. Since I did not keep novalidate, the browser validates the form automatically. But when I do keep novalidate = True, the form does not validate at all.

I do not plan on working on this project further.
